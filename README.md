# simple-mern-project
A simple MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS location sharing project. This has the backend and frontend both linked and starts up on localhost with npm start.

Full backend is in NEBackend.
Full frontend is in react-frontend-01-starting-setup.

This project won't work without the two private files that are missing as I can not include those because they contain private keys.
